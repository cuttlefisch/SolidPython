# This code implements Hobby's algorithm for fitting a cubic Bézier curve onto

# Hobby's algorithm was devised by John D. Hobby and Donald Knuth for use in
# the METAFONT program. Their original paper on the algorithm, titled “Smooth,
# Easy to Compute Interpolating Splines”, was published in 'Discrete and
# Computational Geometry' vol. 1 in 1986. A copy can be found at this URL:
